skInlineCSSPlugin
=================

This symfony plugin contains the skInlineCSS class, which takes an HTML document and CSS, and moves all the CSS properties into inline `style` attributes on the relevant elements.

We use this plugin to move styles inline for HTML emails.



Usage
-----

CSS can either be contained in `<style />` or linked to in `<link rel="stylesheet" />` elements within the HTML, or can be passed in separately.

	<?php
	$c = new skInlineCSS(array(/* options */));
	echo $c->convert($html, $css);

For more detail, see the docblocks in `lib/skInlineCSS.class.php`.

The `skInlineCSS` class is based on [CssToInlineStyles](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/CssToInlineStyles) by Tijs Verkoyen.
The `skCSSSelectorXPathConverter` class is a loose PHP port of part of the old selector engine from [Prototype.js](http://www.prototypejs.org/).
